      <title>Getting an Image</title>

      <description>For most users, before you can do anything with umoci, you have to first have an OCI image. At the time of writing, there is no standard way of getting an OCI image. Distribution is still an open topic in the specification, and there are very few implementations of a distribution extension to the OCI specification. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally worked on one but there is still a lot of work to go before you can skip this step and get OCI images without the need to convert from other things.</description>

      <title>Workflow Optimisation</title>

      <description>One of the first things that a user of umoci may notice is that certain operations can be quite expensive. Notably unpack and repack operations require either scanning through each layer archive of an image, or scanning through the filesystem. Both operations require quite a bit of disk IO, and can take a while. Fedora images are known to be quite large, and can take several seconds to operate on.</description>

      <title>Roadmap</title>

      <description>This document describes an informal roadmap for the future of the umoci project, in both technical and operational aspects. If you feel there is something missing from this document, feel free to contribute.
Improved API Design One of the main goals of umoci is to act as a &amp;ldquo;defacto&amp;rdquo; implementation of the relevant image-spec interfaces. In particular, the oci/cas and oci/casext packages are perfect examples of the style of interface that would be incredibly reusable.</description>

      <title>Architecture</title>

      <description>umoci is a fairly simple tool, that takes advantage of a couple of tricks in order to allow for modification of OCI images. This architecture document is fairly high-level and will likely change once some more of the roadmap is implemented. If you feel something is missing from this document, feel free to contribute.
When umoci was first released, I also published a blog post outlying the original architecture (which has remained fairly similar over time).</description>

      <title>Workflow</title>
      <link>https://umo.ci/quick-start/workflow/</link>

      <guid>https://umo.ci/quick-start/workflow/</guid>
      <description>umoci&amp;rsquo;s workflow is based around an unpack-repack cycle, with some separate configuration steps. Most users are going to be primarily using the unpack and repack subcommands for most uses of umoci.
Unpack Each image consists of a set of layers and a configuration that describes how the image should be used. umoci unpack allows you to take an image and extract its root filesystem and configuration into an runtime bundle. This bundle can be used by an OCI compliant container runtime to spawn a container, but also can be used directly by non-containers (as it is just a directory).</description>

      <title>Security Considerations</title>
      <link>https://umo.ci/reference/security/</link>

      <description>umoci is entrusted with taking a particular image and expanding it on the filesystem (as well as computing deltas of the expanded filesystem). As a result, umoci must be very careful about filesystem access to avoid vulnerabilities that may impact other components of the system. If you feel something is missing from this document, feel free to contribute.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve found a security flaw in umoci that comes from a security consideration we haven&amp;rsquo;t considered before, please follow our instructions on how to responsibly disclose a security issue.</description>

      <title>Creating an Image</title>
      <link>https://umo.ci/quick-start/creating-an-image/</link>

      <description>Creating a new image with umoci is fairly simple, and effectively involves creating an image &amp;ldquo;husk&amp;rdquo; which you can then operate on as though it was a normal image. New images contain no layers, and have a dummy configuration that should be replaced by a user.
If you wish to create a new image layout (which contains nothing except the bare minimum to specify that the image is an OCI image), you can do so with umoci init.</description>

      <title>Garbage Collection</title>
      <link>https://umo.ci/quick-start/garbage-collection/</link>

      <guid>https://umo.ci/quick-start/garbage-collection/</guid>
      <description>Every umoci operation that modifies an image will not delete any now-unused blobs in the image (so as to ensure that any other operations that assume those blobs are present will not error out). However, this will result in a large number of useless blobs remaining in the image after operating on an image for a long enough period of time. umoci gc will garbage collect all blobs that are not reachable from any known image tag.</description>

      <title>Rootless Containers</title>
      <link>https://umo.ci/quick-start/rootless/</link>

      <guid>https://umo.ci/quick-start/rootless/</guid>
      <description>umoci has first class support for rootless containers, and in particular it supports rootless unpacking. This means that an unprivileged user can unpack and repack and image (which is not traditionally possible for most images), as well as generate a runtime configuration that can be used by runc to start a rootless container.
It should noted that the root filesystem created as an unprivileged user will likely not match the root filesystem that a privileged user would create.</description>

      <description>Changelog All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.
Unreleased  Suppress repeated xattr warnings on destination filesystems that do not support xattrs.  0.4.5 - 2019-12-04 Added  Expose umoci subcommands as part of the API, so they can be used by other Go projects. opencontainers/umoci#289 Add extensible hooking to the core libraries in umoci, to allow for third-party media-types to be treated just like first-party ones (the key difference is the introspection and parsing logic).</description>

      <description>Governance Model umoci is an OCI project, and is thus governed under the OCI Charter. ยง5(b)(viii) of the Charter tasks the maintainers of each OCI Project with:
 Creating, maintaining and enforcing governance guidelines for the TDC [of that OCI Project], approved by the maintainers, and which shall be posted visibly for the TDC [of that OCI Project].
 This document describes the governance rules for umoci, and is the authortiative document that describes the governance procedure for umoci.</description>

      <title>Release Procedure</title>

      <description>Release Procedure This document describes the procedure for preparing and publishing an umoci release. Note that in order for a release of umoci to be approved, it must follow the approval procedure described in GOVERNANCE.md.
Changelog Before anything else, you must update the CHANGELOG.md to match the release. This boils down to adding a new header underneath the &amp;ldquo;Unreleased&amp;rdquo; header so that all of the changes are listed as being part of the new release.</description>
